=head1 NAME

TagLib::AudioProperties - A simple, abstract interface to common audio
properties 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The values here are common to most audio formats.  For more specific,
codec dependant values, please see see the subclasses APIs.  This is
meant to compliment the L<TagLib::File|TagLib::File> and
L<TagLib::Tag|TagLib::Tag> APIs in providing a simple interface that
is sufficient for most applications.

=item %_ReadStyle

Reading audio properties from a file can sometimes be very time
consuming and for the most accurate results can often involve reading
the entire file.  Because in many situations speed is critical or the
accuracy of the  values is not particularly important this allows the
level of desired accuracy to be set.

C<keys %TagLib::AudioProperties::_ReadStyle> lists all available
values used in Perl code. 

see L<FLAC::Properties|TagLib::FLAC::Properties>

L<Vorbis::Properties|TagLib::Vorbis::Properties> 

=item I<DESTROY()>

Destroys this AudioProperties instance.

=item I<length()> [pure virtual]

Returns the lenght of the file in seconds.

=item I<bitrate()> [pure virtual]

Returns the most appropriate bit rate for the file in kb/s.  For
constant bitrate formats this is simply the bitrate of the file.  For
variable bitrate formats this is either the average or nominal
bitrate. 

=item I<sampleRate()> [pure virtual] 

Returns the sample rate in Hz.

=item I<channels()> [pure virtual] 

Returns the number of audio channels.
