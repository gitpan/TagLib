=head1 NAME

TagLib::Ogg::File - An implementation of TagLib::File with some
helpers for Ogg based formats 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implementation of Ogg file page and packet rendering and is
of use to Ogg based formats. While the API is small this handles the
non-trivial details of breaking up an Ogg stream into packets and
makes these available (via subclassing) to the codec meta data
implementations.
