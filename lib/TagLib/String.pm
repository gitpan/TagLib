=head1 NAME

TagLib::String - A wide string class suitable for unicode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use TagLib::String;
  
  my $i = TagLib::String->new("blah blah blah");
  print $i->toCString(), "\n"; # got "blah blah blah"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an implicitly shared wide string. For storage it uses
TagLib::wstring, but as this is an I<implementation detail> this of
course could change. Strings are stored internally as
UTF-16BE. (Without the BOM (Byte Order Mark))

The use of implicit sharing means that copying a string is cheap, the
only  cost comes into play when the copy is modified. Prior to that
the string just has a pointer to the data of the parent String. This
also makes this class suitable as a function return type.

In addition to adding implicit sharing, this class keeps track of four
possible encodings, which are the four supported by the ID3v2
standard. 

=over 

=item 

=item %_Type

The four types of string encodings supported by the ID3v2
specification. ID3v1 is assumed to be Latin1 and Ogg Vorbis comments
use UTF8. 

qw(Latin1 UTF16 UTF16BE UTF16LE UTF8)

C<keys %TagLib::String::_Type> lists all available values also.


B<NOTE> C<binmode STDOUT, ":utf8"> to display UTF8 string.

=item I<new()>

Constructs an empty String.

=item I<new(String $s)>

 Make a shallow, implicitly shared, copy of $s. Because this is
 implicitly shared, this method is lightweight and suitable for
 pass-by-value usage.

=item I<new(L<ByteVector|TagLib::ByteVector> $v, PV $t = "Latin1")>

Makes a deep copy of the data in $v.

B<NOTE> This should only be used with the 8-bit codecs Latin1 and
UTF8, when used with other codecs it will simply print a warning and
exit. 

=item I<new(PV $data, PV $encode)>

Constructs a String from the data $data encoded by $encode.

=item I<new(PV $data)>

Constructs a String from the data $data. 

B<NOTE> $data should be the internal format of Perl. It will check the
UTF8 to determine the encode to use(Latin1 or UTF8 in this case).

=item I<DESTROY()>

Destroys this String instance.

=item I<PV to8Bit(BOOL $unicode = FALSE)>

If $unicode is false (the default) this will return a Latin1 encoded
string. If it is true the returned string will be UTF-8 encoded and
UTF8 flag on.

=item I<PV toCString(BOOL $unicode = FALSE)>

see I<to8Bit()>

B<WARNING> Differ from C/C++, the PV will contain a copy of the string
returned by C/C++ code.

=item I<L<Iterator|TagLib::String::Iterator> begin()>

Returns an iterator pointing to the beginning of the string.

=item I<L<Iterator|TagLib::String::Iterator> end()>

Returns an iterator pointing to the end of the string (the position
 after the last character).

=item I<IV find(L<String|TagLib::String> $s, IV $offset = 0)>

Finds the first occurance of pattern $s in this string starting from
$offset. If the pattern is not found, -1 is returned.

=item I<String substr(UV $position, UV $n = 0xffffffff)>

Extract a substring from this string starting at $position and
 continuing for $n characters. 

=item I<String apppend(String $s)>

Append $s to the current string and return a reference to the current
string. 

=item I<String uppper()>

Returns an upper case version of the string.

B<WARNING> This only works for the characters in US-ASCII, i.e. A-Z.

=item I<UV size()>

Returns the size of the string.

=item I<BOOL isEmpty()>

Returns true if the string is empty.

see I<isNull()>

=item I<BOOL isNull()>

Returns true if this string is null -- i.e. it is a copy of the
 String::null string.

B<NOTE> A string can be empty and not null.

see I<isEmpty()>

=item I<L<ByteVector|TagLib::ByteVector> data(PV $type)>

Returns a ByteVector containing the string's data. If $type is Latin1
or UTF8, this will return a vector of 8 bit characters, otherwise it
will use 16 bit characters.

=item I<IV toInt()>

Convert the string to an integer.

=item I<String stripWhiteSpace()>

Returns a string with the leading and trailing whitespace stripped. 

=item I<String number(IV $n)> [static]

Converts the base-10 integer $n to a string.

=item I<PV getChar(IV $i)>

Returns the character at position $i. Encodes by UTF8 and sets UTF8 on
if the returned character is a wide character.

=item I<String copy(String $s)>

Performs a shallow, implicitly shared, copy of $s, overwriting the
String's current data.

=item I<String copy(L<ByteVector|TagLib::ByteVector> $v)>

Performs a deep copy of the data in $d.

=item I<String copy(PV $data)>

Copies $data into current String. Check UTF8 flag to determine the
encode to use (Latin1 or UTF8).

=item I<String null()> [static]

Returns a static null string provided for convenience.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
