=head1 NAME

TagLib::ID3v2::ExtendedHeader - ID3v2 extended header implementation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use TagLib::ID3v2::ExtendedHeader;
  
  my $i = TagLib::ID3v2::ExtendedHeader->new();
  $i->setData($data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements ID3v2 extended headers. It attempts to follow,
both semantically and programatically, the structure specified in the
ID3v2 standard. The API is based on the properties of ID3v2 extended
headers specified there. If any of the terms used in this
documentation are unclear please check the specification in the linked
section. 

=over

=item I<new()>

Constructs an empty ID3v2 extended header.

=item I<DESTROY()>

Destroys the extended header.

=item I<UV size()>

Returns the size of the extended header. This is variable for the
extended header.

=item I<void setData(L<ByteVector|TagLib::ByteVector> $data)>

Sets the data that will be used as the extended header. Since the
  length is not known before the extended header has been parsed, this
  should just be a pointer to the first byte of the extended
  header. It will determine the length internally and make that
  available through size().

=back

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
