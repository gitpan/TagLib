=head1 NAME

TagLib::ID3v2::Footer - ID3v2 footer implementation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use TagLib::ID3v2::Footer;
  
  my $i = TagLib::ID3v2::Footer->new();
  my $v = $i->render($header);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Per the ID3v2 specification, the tag's footer is just a copy of the
information in the header. As such there is no API for reading the
data from the header, it can just as easily be done from the header.

In fact, at this point, TagLib does not even parse the footer since it
is not useful internally. However, if the flag to include a footer has
been set in the ID3v2::Tag, TagLib will render a footer.

=over

=item I<new()>

=item I<DESTROY()>

=item I<UV size()> [static]

Returns the size of the footer. Presently this is always 10 bytes.
